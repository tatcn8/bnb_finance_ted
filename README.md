# Finance on Rails
## By Ted Tash as part of BNB's Apprentice Program

### Deployed at:
An older version of the app is currently deployed at, https://capstonefinance.herokuapp.com/; this link will be updated when the newest version is deployed. 

### Audience:
When my wife and I were engaged, we went through some pre-marital counseling to try and get our marriage started on the right track. Neither one of us had much knowledge, education, or experience in the area of personal finance prior to this. The counselor recommended some of Dave Ramsey's personal finance material, and it has changed the course of our lives for the better. We have been able to do some really neat stuff and help out other young couples/individuals in the arena of personal finance. The audience for this app would be folks who desire to have a digital way to track their personal balance sheets (income vs expenses) and have some tools (data graphs/charts, goal trackers, etc) to help them evaluate this data and plan for their futures.

### Description:
**The purpose of this app is to:**
- Store/track historical financial data
- Help budget/plan for the financial future

My vision for this site is to allow user's to input their past monthly spending in itemized fashion (i.e.their bills) as well as their incomes in a monthly itemized fashion. I hope that by seeing their historical data over time, it will allow them to plan for their future and to reach financial independence. In regards to planning, the site will differentiate between *realized* and *expected* incomes/expenses. Additionally, there will be a goals section allowing users to make goals (large or small) and get help tracking progress towards reaching those goals. I would also like to connest this site to an API with current mortgage rates to help user's plan for home ownership. There will also be a simple compound interest calculator to help plan for long term savings/retirement. My *overall* goal with this site is to enable people to regain control over their finances by having digital tools for evaluating earning/spending data and tools for planning for the future.

### MVP Goals:
**My MVP Goals for this site would be:**
- User Auth 
- Full CRUD function
- Deployment to the web

### Stretch Goals:
**My Stretch Goals for this site would be:**
- Would like to add other helpful features such as a mortgage calculator and a compound interest calculator
- Would like to figure out how to display the past/future data can be displayed together for side by side comparison
- Would like a "goals" tracker section to allow user's to track their progress on financial goals (buying a home, car, retirement)


### Technologies used:
Ruby/Rails were the technologies used in this project. The backend and frontend were built in a single rails app and deployed via Heroku.

### Acknowledgments:
I would like to acknowledge the following people for their help in the creation of this project:
- My wife, Lydia, without whose support I would never have made it this far (not in regards to the project, but actual life)
- My bootcamp instructors, Holly, Brian, and Max who taught me an awful lot
- My friend, Will, who encouraged me to go down the path of software engineering
- All my teammates at BNB
